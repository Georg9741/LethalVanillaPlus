## If true, will prefer scanning the closest nodes first. This might cause performance issues.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Prefer Closest Nodes = true

## If true, will always start a fresh scan. This removes all previously scanned nodes from the UI.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true

## Defines the maximum amount of scan nodes on screen. If you feel like your screen is cluttered, try lowering this value.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 120
# Acceptable value range: From 30 to 666
Scan Nodes Hard Limit = 120

## Defines the delay between each scan node being added to the UI. This will look stupid if set too high. This value is divided by 100.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0.1
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 1
Scan Node Delay = 0.1

## May increase performance, at the cost of ram usage. If true, will use a dictionary for caching. If false, will not cache at all.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Use Dictionary Cache = true

## If true, will check for line of sight every frame. Enabling this could cause performance issues. Vanilla value is true.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Always Check For Line Of Sight = false

## This value defines how many scan nodes can be processed each frame.This value is used in updating and scanning nodes!
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 32
# Acceptable value range: From 1 to 666
Max Scan Nodes To Process Per Frame = 32

[Special Cases]

## If set to true, will allow you to scan nodes of opened blast doors (Vanilla value: false) Enabling this could improve performance.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Show opened blast door scan node = false

## If true, will add BoxColliers to ScanNodes that do not have one. It is not recommended to enable this. This feature was also never tested, so it might not even work.
# Setting type: Boolean

## I true, will hide the rectangle beneath the item name, if there's no text to be displayed.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Hide Empty Scan Node Sub Text = true

## This multiplier is used to define the wait time between adding more to the total displayed value. The lower this number, the faster the animation is updated.The lower this number, the less will be added per updated.For a vanilla-ish feeling, set this to 48.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 100
# Acceptable value range: From 1 to 100
Total Add Wait Multiplier = 100

## This value is used to have a cooldown between scan node updates (Like position updates). The lower this number, the more often it will get updated.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 1.2
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 12
Scan Node Update Timer = 1.2
